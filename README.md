# fezziwig_base_config
## A Drupal 7 feature of modules and settings with which I like to start off.

It's a bit dated, but it still works in the increasingly rare event that I spin up a Drupal 7 site.

Features have always been a bit of a pain, but now that I've spent some time in the Drupal 8 world of config YAML files, I have become nostalgic for these old things...

Enjoy!
